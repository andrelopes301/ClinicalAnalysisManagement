# Clinical Analysis Management Web Application

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a SaaS (Software as a Service) Web platform to allow clinical analysis laboratories to manage the entire analysis process in a simple and efficient manner: scheduling, testing, communication of results, etc.

## Development

The practical work objective is the development of a Web application using ASP.Net Core 2/3, programmed with C# language and utilizing the Razor, ASP.Net Core Entity Framework, ASP.Net Core Identity, and MS SQLServer (localdb) tools.

## Features

-   Scheduling of analysis appointments
-   Testing management
-   Communication of results
-   User authentication and management

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

 - ASP.Net Core 3: a high-performance, open-source framework for       building web applications and APIs.
 - C# language: a modern, object-oriented programming language used for    developing a wide range of applications. 
 - Razor: a templating language for building dynamic web pages in    ASP.NET. 
 - ASP.Net Core Entity Framework: an object-relational mapping (ORM)    framework for .NET that allows for easy database access. 
 - ASP.Net Core Identity: a membership system for building secure,    customizable authentication and authorization into ASP.NET    Core    applications. 
 - MS SQLServer (localdb): a free, lightweight version of Microsoft SQL    Server Express, designed for local development and  testing.
